# Chart.js-example
Chart.js is a free, open-source JavaScript library for data visualization.
In this example I use a line graph to display minecraft sales from 2010 - 2020 by the millions.
some of the things I learned by creating this example is
- how to intialize chart.js
- how to use gradient values with addColorStop within chart.js
- how to create and display graph tension values
- how to create and display graph animations
- how to create a larger hit radius for the bubbles
- how to create a larger hover radius for the bubbles
- how to make the bubbles larger
